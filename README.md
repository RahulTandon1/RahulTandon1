### Ayo Whaddup? ðŸ‘‹
(that was  meant to bring a smile to your face)

I write Python & Javascript.

I'm a backend-focussed fullstack dev.

Recently, I've been dabbling into _systems_ more generally & pondering about a day in the life of a web request: from browser to container/VM.

Technologies: Express.js, Next, Gatsby, Django, Flask, MongoDB, MySQL, Sass/SCSS, Bootstrap
